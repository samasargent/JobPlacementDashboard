# Live Project

## Introduction

I worked as part of a small team to create an interactive website for a theatre company local to Portland. The purpose of the website was to manage content and productions for the company. I mainly worked on the Cast Member section of the website, where data on the different members of the company would be stored. We worked in a two week sprint to get the basic structure of the website set up and designed. I worked on several [back end stories](#back-end-stories)â€”mostly setting up two of the main models for the website. I also worked on the [front end](#front-end-stories) of the website, utilizing Bootstrap and JavaScript to design the CRUD pages for the CastMember class. I learned good version control and [other skills](#other-skills-learned) from working on this team over the two weeks.

Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets and navigation links. I also have some full code files in this repo for the larger functionalities I implemented.

## Other Skills Learned

* _How to break down a story into smaller parts._ More than once, I would have a story that would seem complicated a first. I figured out how to break it down into steps that I could do. Then I would have a series of steps to complete, rather than a nebulous goal.
* _How to research a new subject to solve a problem._ Many times on this project, I ran into problems I needed to solve that I had little to no familiarity with. I quickly learned how to find the kind of answers I needed through persisting in research until I understood the subject enough to come up with a solution for the story.
* _How utilize version control to better work as part of a team._ I became more familiar with using branches and making changes to code alongside other people. I learned how important it is to stay in communication with the people you're working with. Also I learned from experience how valuable making frequent commits and checking in code can prevent a lot of problems that would be caused by waiting to save or test code until you have a big chunk of it.
